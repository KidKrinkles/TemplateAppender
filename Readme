Unfortunately, I didn't get to work for CCS very long. 
But, I was working with one of the US Team members to develop a tool to quickly allow us to fill templates out that were previously far too long and technical.
We made a consolidated version for clients to fill out.
This program would target the consolidated, and the original template used by our technical team in India.
Then, it would just fill out the template based on how it was mapped out.
Basic utility program to be honest.
